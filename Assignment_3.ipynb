    "##1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "ANS- Functions are advantageous in programs because they promote code organization, reusability, modularity, abstraction, readability, and maintenance. They allow you to break down code into smaller, logical units, making it easier to understand and modify. Functions also enable code reuse, testing, and debugging, leading to more efficient and effective programming."

    "##2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?\n",
    "ANS- In Python, the code in a function runs when it is called. When you define a function in Python, you are essentially creating a named block of code that will be executed only when the function is called or invoked. The function definition specifies the instructions to be executed, but those instructions are not executed until the function is actually called."

    "ANS - In Python, a function is a named block of code that performs a specific task or set of operations. It is defined using the def statement and can take input parameters (arguments) and optionally return a value. function call is the actual invocation or execution of a function in order to execute its code and perform the desired operations. It involves using the function name followed by parentheses ()"

    "Global scope\n",

    "\n",
    "Local scopes\n",

    "##6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "ANS- When a function call returns in Python, the local variables in the function's scope are destroyed, and their values are no longer accessible. The memory allocated to these local variables is released. This means that any variables defined within the function's scope, including function parameters and locally declared variables, cease to exist outside of the function. They are deallocated, and any attempt to access them after the function call has returned will result in a NameError because the variables are no longer in scope."

    "##7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "ANS- The concept of a return value in programming, including in Python, refers to the value that a function can send back to the caller after it has finished executing. When a function encounters a return statement, it immediately exits, and the value specified in the return statement is passed back as the result of the function call. The return value allows a function to provide a result or output that can be used by the calling code. It enables functions to perform calculations, process data, or perform any other task and then return the computed result to the caller."

    "##8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
    "ANS- If a function does not have a return statement, or if the return statement does not specify a value, the function call will implicitly return None in Python. None is a special built-in constant in Python that represents the absence of a value. It is often used to indicate that a function does not return any meaningful result or when a variable or object has no assigned value."

    "ANS- To prevent a program from crashing when encountering an error, you can implement error handling techniques.

This allows you to catch and handle exceptions gracefully, preventing the program from abruptly terminating.\n",
